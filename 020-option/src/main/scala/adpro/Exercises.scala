/* We create OrderedPoint as a trait instead of a class, so we can mix it into
 * Points (this allows to use java.awt.Point constructors without
 * reimplementing them). As constructors are not inherited, We would have to
 * reimplement them in the subclass, if classes not traits are used.  This is
 * not a problem if I mix in a trait construction time. */
